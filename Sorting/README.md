| :-----------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
|       Binary Array or Array with two types        | Hoare's Partition of Quick Sort |
|              Array with three types               |            DNF Sort             |
|      Array of size n and small ranged values      |           Count Sort            |
|  Array of size n and range is of size n^2 or n^3  |           Radix Sort            |
| Array of Uniformily Distributed Data over a Range |           Bucket Sort           |
|       Sorting when Memory writes are costly       |           Cycle Sort            |
|         When adjacents swaps are Allowed          |  Bubble Sort or Cocktail Sort   |
|             When Array size is small              |         Insertion Sort          |
|        When Available extra Memory is less        |           Shell Sort            |

### General Purpose Sorting Algorithm

- Merge Sort - Best suited for Linked List
- Quick Sort - Best suited for Arrays
- Heap Sort

### Hybrid Algorithms

- Tim Sort -> Mix of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort used in Python and Java
- Intro Sort -> Mix of Insertion Sort, Heap Sort and Quick Sort used in C++

## For Stable Sorting

- Stable Sort -> Implemented using Merge Sort
